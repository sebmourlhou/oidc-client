Changes for OIDC-Client distribution

1.00 2025-08-15
  Note : multiple breaking changes to the framework plugin class in this version
  - get_valid_identity() replaces get_stored_identity(), get_stored_identity() still exists but returns the stored identity even if the identity has expired
  - New classes OIDC::Client::Identity and OIDC::Client::AccessToken
  - has_expired(), has_scope(), get_identity_expiration_time() and has_access_token_expired() methods have been moved to these new classes
  - get_valid_identity() and get_stored_identity() now return an OIDC::Client::Identity object
  - verify_token() and get_valid_access_token() now return an OIDC::Client::AccessToken object
  - New methods for framework plugins : store_access_token(), get_stored_access_token() and delete_stored_data()
  - The 'store_mode' configuration entry has been moved to the provider level. Its value can be different between providers

  - The stored identity now expires by default. The expiration time is the one defined in the ID token, but you can also override this value by specifying the lifetime in the parameters.
